# Loading Screen for React Applications

It is a simple component that was created for the only reason of providing a responsive loading screen for applications made in ReactJs. For the moment there are 2 spinners inside the project , the main spinner is running but you can find another inside the file txt(It is only layout).

### 1.-Only install "npm i loading-screen-kraenau"

### 2.-Import the package as "import Spinner from 'loading-screen-kraenau'"

### 3.- Finally , use the component < Spinner ></ Spinner > in every section that you need
